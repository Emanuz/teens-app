		<p>Think about it. Where are the passionate conversations today about communing with God through fasting and prayer? We seem to ﬁnd it easier to talk much of plans and principles for proclaiming the gospel and planting churches, and to talk little of the power of God that is necessary for this gospel to be proclaimed and the church to be planted.</p>
		<div class="scripture">
			<h2 class="from">Psalm 63:1–5</h2>
			<p>O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water. So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory. Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands. My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food.</p>
